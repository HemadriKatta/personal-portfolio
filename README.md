# personal-portfolio


A personal portfolio website serves as a digital showcase of an individual's skills, experiences, and accomplishments. It is a dynamic and interactive platform designed to highlight one's professional background, projects, and expertise. Through a combination of well-crafted content, engaging visuals, and thoughtful design, a personal portfolio website aims to impress potential employers, clients, or collaborators.
